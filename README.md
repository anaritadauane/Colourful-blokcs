# Colourful-blokcs
The main goal is to create  a tetris game.

Group name: Las Hermanas 

Group members: Ana Rita Dauane and Tafadzwa Matunhike

Group mentor: Mos Tsistsi

Project title: Tetris

Project page: https://github.com/anaritadauane/Colourful-blokcs

Instructions for use (allowable actions): The program is a fun and very interative. The program will not need of internet acess but it will have the event-handlers of the keys, time and it will have levels of dificulty from easy, normal and difficult. The game will be based on grafics and the WPF interface will be used the Windows Presentation foundations which will allow us to make the game the most creative possible and with more interations. It will have sound effects, score board and a way to change the level from 1 to 5 and if possible change the theme of the blocks and also change the angles of it. there is going to be a button where you can stop the game. 






[Provide DETAILED  instructions on how to run AND interact with your program. If we cannot run it with relative ease, it will NOT be marked! So if it needs to be saved in a specific folder, or needs Internet access, or needs anything beyond simply double clicking the executable, document all that here. This is very IMPORTANT! Also, list all forms of interaction here, so if your program allows the user to press ‘Q’ to exit, or ‘left arrow’ or ‘right arrow’ to do specific things, document that here as well. If we cannot figure out how to interact with your program and nothing is documented, it will NOT be marked!]

Tools used: WPF

Concepts used: Will   use Graphics, if statements, timers and lists.
[List ALL aspects of the CSc 102 curriculum that your project uses. So if your program uses Lists, Files, Recursion, Dictionaries, Custom classes, etc.; document them here and provide directions as to where those concepts are used in the code base. Please use the standard topics list on the Think Sharply with C# web page for the list of anticipated topics/concepts]

Assumptions: The system will be expected to run normally and end the game when the blocks touch
[State ANY assumptions about how you expect the system will be used or run]

Limitations: [State ANY limitations concerning what your program cannot do, though those functions may be implied by the nature of the project]
